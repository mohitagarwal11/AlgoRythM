##Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based sorting algorithm visualizer built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project focuses on clearly demonstrating how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step through animated bar comparisons and swaps.

##Features

Visualizes multiple sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Adjustable array size and animation speed

Pause / resume sorting

Clear visual highlighting for comparisons and swaps

Clean, minimal UI designed for learning and demonstration

##How it Works

An array of values is generated and rendered as vertical bars.

Each sorting algorithm records its operations (comparisons, swaps, overwrites) as animation steps.

These steps are played sequentially to animate the sorting process.

The visualization logic is decoupled from the sorting logic for clarity and maintainability.

##Tech Stack

HTML – Structure

CSS – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Logic, animations, and algorithms

No external libraries or frameworks are used.

##Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git


Open index.html in your browser.

No build steps or dependencies required.

##Notes

Animation timing reflects visualization speed, not real-world algorithm performance.

This project is intended for educational and demonstrative purposes.
